        </li>
        <li>
            Turn up the heat to high and add your ground beef. Cook until it starts to get a brown color.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add tomato paste and let it heat up. After that pour in your red wine and let it reduce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then add your peeled tomatoes and fill up the pan with water. Let it cook on a low heat for at least two hours to get a nice flavour. Season with salt and pepper if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat your oven to 200Â°C and melt some butter in another saucepan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once melted add a tablespoon of flour. Then pour in the milk and let it cook until the sauce thickens. Season with pepper and some nutmeg.
        </li>
        <li>
            Start layering your lasagna in an oven form. Start with your Bolognese followed by the Bechamel sauce and the fresh lasagna sheets. Stack until you reach the moon (or run out of Bolognese).

            Add you Mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top and put the lasagna into the oven for 30 min. Garnish with some fresh basil.
