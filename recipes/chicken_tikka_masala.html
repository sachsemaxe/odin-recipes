    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Chicken Tikka Masala is a beloved British Indian curry dish, rich and creamy with a subtle heat. It's thought to have originated in Glasgow, Scotland, and has since become a global favorite. The tender, marinated chicken is cooked in a fragrant tomato-based sauce, infused with warm spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala. The result is a dish that is both comforting and complex, perfect for sharing with friends and family.
